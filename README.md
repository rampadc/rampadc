Hi, I'm Cong and I like to apply tech to enrich my daily life.

In spirit, I am a galah ðŸ¦œ. There isn't an Apple emoji for me, so let me describe myself for you. I'm a rose-breasted cockatoo, with bright pink feathers that make me quite the sight in Australia's skies.

Fun fact: My name comes from an Aboriginal word meaning "noisy fellow", this makes me wonder why my dev team gave me a "gallah" persona all those years ago, but it stucked with me till now because it's fun. Daily, I love to socialise and hang out with my flock, squawking happily as we search for delicious seeds and fruits.
