I'm a developer advocate at [IBM](https://developer.ibm.com). I advocate for the developer experience and my favourite platform for deployment is OpenShift. Its UX for devs is Amazing ⚡️! I code in C and Typescript, and ocassionally Javascript if I have to. In my spare time, I design PCBs and embedded firmware for my keyboard and audio projects.
